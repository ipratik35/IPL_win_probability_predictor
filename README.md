# Problem:
The problem addressed in this project was to predict the win probabilities for matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) using machine learning.
The challenge involved developing an accurate model that could effectively predict match results.

# Solution:
The high-level solution included developing a machine learning model specifically using Logistic Regression to predict win probabilities for IPL matches. 
The focus was on achieving high accuracy in predicting match results. 
The project was then deployed using Streamlit to make the predictions accessible through a user-friendly interface. 

# How I Approached It:
The approach started with the selection of Logistic Regression as the machine learning model, emphasizing its ability to achieve high accuracy for predicting match results. 
The model was trained using relevant IPL data to ensure its effectiveness. 
Streamlit was chosen as the deployment platform to create a user-friendly interface. 

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, the IPL Win Probability Predictor successfully tackled the challenge of predicting match outcomes in the IPL. The chosen approach, involving Logistic Regression and Streamlit deployment, proved effective in achieving high accuracy and user accessibility. The project not only met its primary objective of predicting win probabilities but also demonstrated the potential to offer valuable insights for businesses seeking to make strategic decisions and optimize their investments in the context of IPL matches.
